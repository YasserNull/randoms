# Welcome to **YasserNull**'s Profile! :)
I'm Yasser, 17, from Algeria.  
I just want to create something helpful for others ^_^

I love programming and tech in general.    
I code using only my phone.  
  
I mess around with random programming languages, but the ones I really like are:    
Asm / C / Shell    
Others I’ve learned: Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript (not really into it)  
  
I like the Linux kernel, GNU/Linux systems, and Android.  
  
I make very random stuff like:    
- Android apps (Normal, Root, Shizuku)   
- Magisk & Xposed modules        
- Tools &  Scripts
  
## Greatest Things I’ve Achieved
- Bot Player Addon — 1M+ downloads    
- Server Form Overlay — an actual innovation in Minecraft addon development  
  
## Projects I Enjoyed Working On
- chroot-distro    
- physics-addon  
  
I hope to keep learning and make even better stuff in the future =).
